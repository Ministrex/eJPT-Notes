# Host Discovery / Enumeration
#### Let's find out what we are working with.  We are completely blind.

### Ping Sweep, who can we find on the network?


#### fping:
````bash
fping -a -g {IP RANGE} 2>/dev/null
````
#### fping example:
````bash
fping -a -g 10.10.10.0/8 2>/dev/null
`````
#### Nmap Ping Sweep:
````bash
 nmap -sn 10.10.10.0/8 | grep -oP '(?<=Nmap scan report for )[^ ]*'
````

# Enumerate Hosts Found on Network
#### Once you have found alive hosts on a network, its time to knock on the doors.

#### Nmap TCP Quick Scan (step 1)
````bash
nmap -sC -sV 10.10.10.10
````
#### Nmap TCP Full Scan (Step 2)
````bash
nmap -sC -sV -p- 10.10.10.10
````
#### Nmap UDP Quick Scan
````bash
nmap -sU -sV 10.10.10.10
````
#### Always save your scans, you never know when you need to pull them up.
````bash
nmap -sn 10.10.10.0/24 -oN hosts.nmap
````

# Find Common Vulnerabilities
#### After you have done all of your scans, and identified open ports on your target, it's time to see if any services are vulnerable.
